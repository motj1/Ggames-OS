# Ggames OS

In my OS there are 6 games, Tic Tac Toe against an AI, Snake, Chess, a jumping cube, Prime spiral, and Conways game of life.

## Opening screen

You can type anything here and press enter or escape for no newline to be created, the available games are shown on the start screen. 
The games include:
 - Tic Tac Toe
 - Snake
 - Chess
 - A jumping cube with a stationary enemy
 - Prime spiral
 - Conways game of life

### Tic Tac Toe

Tic tac toe is against an AI and uses the minimax algorithm.

### Snake

Snake uses the arrow keys to move and ends when you hit the side. It only moves when you enter input because of the inability for multithreading and becasue I must wait for input.

### Chess

For Chess you must capture the king to end the game, there is no castling and it is a fairly flawed implementation but was very fun to make.

### A jumping cube

For this game you can jump with space or the up arrow and go left or right, this is limited because I must wait for user input and is quite glitchy.

### Prime spiral

For the prime spiral you run it and the ulam spiral will be drawn on the screen to fill it.

### Conways game of life

Conways game of life is a simulation which shows emergence properties from a simple set of rules and my implementation creates a random set of dead or alive cells and applies the rules to it.

## Compilation and setup

To setup and compile go to [this github page](https://github.com/davidcallanan/os-series/tree/ep2), I used this for the base os and it goes alongside [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkrpUaGThTQ&list=RDCMUCUVahoidFA7F3Asfvamrm7w&index=3).


This is how to compile if you dont want to go to the other page:
 - Linux or MacOS: `docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd)":/root/env myos-buildenv`
 - Windows (CMD): `docker run --rm -it -v "%cd%":/root/env myos-buildenv`
 - Windows (PowerShell): `docker run --rm -it -v "${pwd}:/root/env" myos-buildenv`

And to run you must have qemu installed and in your path:
 - `qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom dist/x86_64/kernel.iso`

Or you can use VirtualBox:
 - Install virtual box from [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
 - Make a new machine and select:
    - the iso image as the one in path to project/dist/x86_64/kernel.iso
    - Type as other
    - Other/unknown (64-bit)
    - Leave the memory as it is
    - Select (do not add virtual disk)
    - Finish
 - Then Start the machine, it will be slower so you can go through and decrease all of the MSDelay commands a factor of 10.
